/// An unordered collection of unique elements.
///
/// You use a set instead of an array when you need to test efficiently for
/// membership and you aren't concerned with the order of the elements in the
/// collection, or when you need to ensure that each element appears only once
/// in a collection.
///
/// You can create a set with any element type that conforms to the `Hashable`
/// protocol. By default, most types in the standard library are hashable,
/// including strings, numeric and Boolean types, enumeration cases without
/// associated values, and even sets themselves.
///
/// Swift makes it as easy to create a new set as to create a new array. Simply
/// assign an array literal to a variable or constant with the `Set` type
/// specified.
///
///     let ingredients: Set = ["cocoa beans", "sugar", "cocoa butter", "salt"]
///     if ingredients.contains("sugar") {
///         print("No thanks, too sweet.")
///     }
///     // Prints "No thanks, too sweet."
///
/// Set Operations
/// ==============
///
/// Sets provide a suite of mathematical set operations. For example, you can
/// efficiently test a set for membership of an element or check its
/// intersection with another set:
///
/// - Use the `contains(_:)` method to test whether a set contains a specific
///   element.
/// - Use the "equal to" operator (`==`) to test whether two sets contain the
///   same elements.
/// - Use the `isSubset(of:)` method to test whether a set contains all the
///   elements of another set or sequence.
/// - Use the `isSuperset(of:)` method to test whether all elements of a set
///   are contained in another set or sequence.
/// - Use the `isStrictSubset(of:)` and `isStrictSuperset(of:)` methods to test
///   whether a set is a subset or superset of, but not equal to, another set.
/// - Use the `isDisjoint(with:)` method to test whether a set has any elements
///   in common with another set.
///
/// You can also combine, exclude, or subtract the elements of two sets:
///
/// - Use the `union(_:)` method to create a new set with the elements of a set
///   and another set or sequence.
/// - Use the `intersection(_:)` method to create a new set with only the
///   elements common to a set and another set or sequence.
/// - Use the `symmetricDifference(_:)` method to create a new set with the
///   elements that are in either a set or another set or sequence, but not in
///   both.
/// - Use the `subtracting(_:)` method to create a new set with the elements of
///   a set that are not also in another set or sequence.
///
/// You can modify a set in place by using these methods' mutating
/// counterparts: `formUnion(_:)`, `formIntersection(_:)`,
/// `formSymmetricDifference(_:)`, and `subtract(_:)`.
///
/// Set operations are not limited to use with other sets. Instead, you can
/// perform set operations with another set, an array, or any other sequence
/// type.
///
///     var primes: Set = [2, 3, 5, 7]
///
///     // Tests whether primes is a subset of a Range<Int>
///     print(primes.isSubset(of: 0..<10))
///     // Prints "true"
///
///     // Performs an intersection with an Array<Int>
///     let favoriteNumbers = [5, 7, 15, 21]
///     print(primes.intersection(favoriteNumbers))
///     // Prints "[5, 7]"
///
/// Sequence and Collection Operations
/// ==================================
///
/// In addition to the `Set` type's set operations, you can use any nonmutating
/// sequence or collection methods with a set.
///
///     if primes.isEmpty {
///         print("No primes!")
///     } else {
///         print("We have \(primes.count) primes.")
///     }
///     // Prints "We have 4 primes."
///
///     let primesSum = primes.reduce(0, +)
///     // 'primesSum' == 17
///
///     let primeStrings = primes.sorted().map(String.init)
///     // 'primeStrings' == ["2", "3", "5", "7"]
///
/// You can iterate through a set's unordered elements with a `for`-`in` loop.
///
///     for number in primes {
///         print(number)
///     }
///     // Prints "5"
///     // Prints "7"
///     // Prints "2"
///     // Prints "3"
///
/// Many sequence and collection operations return an array or a type-erasing
/// collection wrapper instead of a set. To restore efficient set operations,
/// create a new set from the result.
///
///     let primesStrings = primes.map(String.init)
///     // 'primesStrings' is of type Array<String>
///     let primesStringsSet = Set(primes.map(String.init))
///     // 'primesStringsSet' is of type Set<String>
///
/// Bridging Between Set and NSSet
/// ==============================
///
/// You can bridge between `Set` and `NSSet` using the `as` operator. For
/// bridging to be possible, the `Element` type of a set must be a class, an
/// `@objc` protocol (a protocol imported from Objective-C or marked with the
/// `@objc` attribute), or a type that bridges to a Foundation type.
///
/// Bridging from `Set` to `NSSet` always takes O(1) time and space. When the
/// set's `Element` type is neither a class nor an `@objc` protocol, any
/// required bridging of elements occurs at the first access of each element,
/// so the first operation that uses the contents of the set (for example, a
/// membership test) can take O(*n*).
///
/// Bridging from `NSSet` to `Set` first calls the `copy(with:)` method
/// (`- copyWithZone:` in Objective-C) on the set to get an immutable copy and
/// then performs additional Swift bookkeeping work that takes O(1) time. For
/// instances of `NSSet` that are already immutable, `copy(with:)` returns the
/// same set in constant time; otherwise, the copying performance is
/// unspecified. The instances of `NSSet` and `Set` share buffer using the
/// same copy-on-write optimization that is used when two instances of `Set`
/// share buffer.

/// Getting and Setting Dictionary Values
/// =====================================

/// subscript. Subscripting with a key takes the following form:
///
///     print(responseMessages[200])
///     // Prints "Optional("OK")"
///
/// Subscripting a dictionary with a key returns an optional value, because a
/// dictionary might not hold a value for the key that you use in the
/// subscript.
///
/// The next example uses key-based subscripting of the `responseMessages`
/// dictionary with two keys that exist in the dictionary and one that does
/// not.
///
///     let httpResponseCodes = [200, 403, 301]
///     for code in httpResponseCodes {
///         if let message = responseMessages[code] {
///             print("Response \(code): \(message)")
///         } else {
///             print("Unknown response \(code)")
///         }
///     }
///     // Prints "Response 200: OK"
///     // Prints "Response 403: Access forbidden"
///     // Prints "Unknown response 301"
///
/// You can also update, modify, or remove keys and values from a dictionary
/// using the key-based subscript. To add a new key-value pair, assign a value
/// to a key that isn't yet a part of the dictionary.
///
///     responseMessages[301] = "Moved permanently"
///     print(responseMessages[301])
///     // Prints "Optional("Moved permanently")"
///
/// Update an existing value by assigning a new value to a key that already
/// exists in the dictionary. If you assign `nil` to an existing key, the key
/// and its associated value are removed. The following example updates the
/// value for the `404` code to be simply "Not found" and removes the
/// key-value pair for the `500` code entirely.
///
///     responseMessages[404] = "Not found"
///     responseMessages[500] = nil
///     print(responseMessages)
///     // Prints "[301: "Moved permanently", 200: "OK", 403: "Access forbidden", 404: "Not found"]"
///
/// In a mutable `Dictionary` instance, you can modify in place a value that
/// you've accessed through a keyed subscript. The code sample below declares a
/// dictionary called `interestingNumbers` with string keys and values that
/// are integer arrays, then sorts each array in-place in descending order.
///
///     var interestingNumbers = ["primes": [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17],

///
/// Iterating Over the Contents of a Dictionary
/// ===========================================
///
/// Every dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. You can
/// iterate over a dictionary using a `for`-`in` loop, decomposing each
/// key-value pair into the elements of a tuple.
///
///     let imagePaths = ["star": "/glyphs/star.png",
///                       "portrait": "/images/content/portrait.jpg",
///                       "spacer": "/images/shared/spacer.gif"]
///
///     for (name, path) in imagePaths {
///         print("The path to '\(name)' is '\(path)'.")
///     }
///     // Prints "The path to 'star' is '/glyphs/star.png'."
///     // Prints "The path to 'portrait' is '/images/content/portrait.jpg'."
///     // Prints "The path to 'spacer' is '/images/shared/spacer.gif'."
///
/// The order of key-value pairs in a dictionary is stable between mutations
/// but is otherwise unpredictable. If you need an ordered collection of
/// key-value pairs and don't need the fast key lookup that `Dictionary`
/// provides, see the `KeyValuePairs` type for an alternative.
///
/// You can search a dictionary's contents for a particular value using the
/// `contains(where:)` or `firstIndex(where:)` methods supplied by default
/// implementation. The following example checks to see if `imagePaths` contains
/// any paths in the `"/glyphs"` directory:
///
///     let glyphIndex = imagePaths.firstIndex(where: { $0.value.hasPrefix("/glyphs") })
///     if let index = glyphIndex {
///         print("The '\(imagePaths[index].key)' image is a glyph.")
///     } else {
///         print("No glyphs found!")
///     }
///     // Prints "The 'star' image is a glyph."
///
/// Note that in this example, `imagePaths` is subscripted using a dictionary
/// index. Unlike the key-based subscript, the index-based subscript returns
/// the corresponding key-value pair as a non-optional tuple.
///
///     print(imagePaths[glyphIndex!])
///     // Prints "(key: "star", value: "/glyphs/star.png")"
///
/// A dictionary's indices stay valid across additions to the dictionary as
/// long as the dictionary has enough capacity to store the added values
/// without allocating more buffer. When a dictionary outgrows its buffer,
/// existing indices may be invalidated without any notification.
///
/// When you know how many new values you're adding to a dictionary, use the
/// `init(minimumCapacity:)` initializer to allocate the correct amount of
/// buffer.
///
/// Bridging Between Dictionary and NSDictionary
/// ============================================
///
/// You can bridge between `Dictionary` and `NSDictionary` using the `as`
/// operator. For bridging to be possible, the `Key` and `Value` types of a
/// dictionary must be classes, `@objc` protocols, or types that bridge to
/// Foundation types.
///
/// Bridging from `Dictionary` to `NSDictionary` always takes O(1) time and
/// space. When the dictionary's `Key` and `Value` types are neither classes
/// nor `@objc` protocols, any required bridging of elements occurs at the
/// first access of each element. For this reason, the first operation that
/// uses the contents of the dictionary may take O(*n*).
///
/// Bridging from `NSDictionary` to `Dictionary` first calls the `copy(with:)`
